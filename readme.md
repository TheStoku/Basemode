Me presents...
The official AAD (Attack and defence) gamemode for Liberty Unleashed! It was previously dedicated for public release to play clanwars by Liberty City Killers [LCK] clan and to let other clans/players play it on their own servers too. I've started development of this gamemode at around 2010 when I was a beta tester of LU and current version is from 2015.

# The gamemode contains:
- 30 unique bases,
- 2 spawns for attackers,
- 1 closed lobby,
- well balanced weapons system to make every weapons useful, to avoid shotgun only fights or M16. Every weapon is powerful here and has it pros and cons,
- complete AAD logic (timeout, killed all players, picked up the base, draws),
- only attackers can enter vehicles and this is a basic the idea of AAD,
- administrator luid loging in,
- admin commands: /bmlogin <pass> (login as administrator), /base <id>, /end, /switch, /add <player id>, /help, /t1/2name <team name>, /resetscore, /del <player id>, /add <player id>
- player commands: /votebase <id>, /fix or /fix2 to show/hide mouse cursor and toggle camera movement (it was messy sometimes, probably LU bug), /bridgefix
- a teamchat on "Y" key,

# TODO:
- the easiest thing: it needs adding "DEBUG" variable in client and server to hide debug messages with "if ( DEBUG ) Message(...)"
- spectator camera
- new bases and spawnpoints for attackers
- polishing GUI
- showing only allied team players on radar (sadly, LU was missing functions to complete this and I'm not sure if it's possible)
and the last one: cleaning source from obsolete things.

This AAD was inspired by Basemode from MTA:SA by [ANO]Rhbk.
